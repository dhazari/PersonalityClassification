1.	Create a folder in Google Drive. We will call this folder "X"
2.	Within "X", Download and unzip the ZIP file mentioned in DATA.
     - You should see the Folder "Personality Disorders_ Theory, Research, and treatement
3. Now, store the BPD_word_analysis code IN folder X
4. ENSURE that there are NO OTHER files in X other than the above mentioned folder and file
5. Run the code in google collab. You will be asked to mount.
6. If you would like to add more articles, add either PDF or HTML text in one of the YEAR folders.
